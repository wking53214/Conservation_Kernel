# Changelog

## 0.1.0 (2026-09-07)

First versioned release. The kernel has been in use as a pinned git
dependency of `sentinel_os` (every governed decision routes through its
conservation boundary), as an installed package in `observe-perceive`'s
governance chain, and by `GEMS`'s transport experiments.

What this release is:

- `ConservationKernel`: `register_root` -> `submit` -> `reconstruct` facade
  over an `EvidenceRegistry`, an `IndependentVerifier` and an append-only
  `ConservationLedger`.
- The verifier recomputes observed changes from artifact digests and never
  trusts a declaration: an undeclared change to a protected dimension, a
  declared hash that does not match the artifact, or a self-verification are
  each refused with a named violation.
- A replay (duplicate output artifact id) or an unregistered parent is refused
  by the ledger with `LedgerError`.
- Python 3.11+, no runtime dependencies. `pytest` for development only.

Verified for this release (external audit, 2026-09-07):

- 52 tests pass in a fresh clone with no sibling repository present.
- The wheel installs and imports from a clean virtual environment.
- No unused imports, no bare excepts (ruff 0.15.22, now a CI gate).

Known limits, stated rather than implied:

- `build_ground_truth()` and the hostile corpus in `experiments.py` are
  synthetic and authored alongside the verifier. `TOUCHSTONE`, a separate
  repository, holds the only non-synthetic ground truth in the ecosystem.
- Ledger refusals are raised, not returned as `VerificationResult`; consumers
  that want a uniform verdict shape must catch `LedgerError` (observe-perceive's
  adapter does).
